# Sovereign Hybrid Cloud PoC
**Demonstrating Verifiable Data Sovereignty across Public Cloud (e.g., Telefonica) and On-Premise Infrastructure**

This Proof of Concept implements the **AegisSovereignAI** architecture to create a contiguous Chain of Trust between a public cloud and a sovereign private cloud (on-premise).

## Overview
This directory contains a proof-of-concept implementation demonstrating sovereign hybrid cloud unified identity with hardware-rooted verifiable geofencing and residency proofs using SPIRE, Keylime, and Envoy. This POC addresses the challenges of the traditional non-verifiable security model by providing cryptographically verifiable proofs that bind workload identity, host integrity, and geolocation into unified credentials.

**Slides:** [View Presentation](https://onedrive.live.com/?id=746ADA9DC9BA7CB7%21sa416cb345794427ab085a20f8ccc0edd&cid=746ADA9DC9BA7CB7&redeem=aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL2IvYy83NDZhZGE5ZGM5YmE3Y2I3L0VUVExGcVNVVjNwQ3NJV2lENHpNRHQwQlh6U3djQ01HWDhjQS1xbGxLZm1Zdnc%5FZT1PTnJqZjE&parId=746ADA9DC9BA7CB7%21s95775661177f4ef5a4ba84313cd3795a&o=OneUp)

## The Architecture Scenario
This PoC simulates a real-world regulated environment:
- **The Public Zone (Public Cloud - e.g., Telefonica):** Represents a scalable environment where initial processing occurs (the Client).
- **The Trusted Zone (On-Premise):** Represents the Private Sovereign Cloud where the Root of Trust is established and sensitive, regulated data (e.g., Banking or Healthcare Secrets) is stored (the Server).
- **The Trust Bridge (AegisSovereignAI):** A unified control plane that issues short-lived, hardware-rooted credentials allowing the two zones to communicate only if strict integrity and location policies are met.

## The Problem
Current security approaches for AI inference applications, secret stores, system agents, and model repositories face **critical gaps** that are amplified in edge AI deployments. The traditional security model relies on bearer tokens, proof-of-possession tokens, and IP-based geofencing, which are vulnerable to replay attacks, account manipulation, and location spoofing.

![The Problem: A Fragile and Non-Verifiable Security Model](images/Slide6.PNG)

The diagram illustrates a traditional security architecture for AI inference applications showing:
1. End user host sending inference data with bearer tokens and source IP to a high-compliance application (e.g., a Private Wealth app for **High-Net-Worth Clients**) in Sovereign Cloud
2. Workload host requesting secrets from Customer-managed key vault using bearer/proof-of-possession tokens
3. Key vault retrieving encrypted models from storage

The diagram highlights three critical security challenges:
- **Host-Affinity Realization Challenges**: Bearer token replay, proof-of-possession token vulnerabilities to orchestration/RBAC abuse
- **Geolocation-Affinity Realization Challenges**: IP-based geofencing bypass via VPNs/proxies
- **Static and Isolated Security Challenges**: Non-verifiable monitoring systems

## The Solution: The Sovereign Trust Loop
Our solution provides a **Unified Identity & Trust Framework** that secures the entire AI lifecycle. By binding workload identity, host hardware integrity, and verifiable geolocation into a single cryptographic credential, we satisfy the requirements for Ingress, Processing, and Egress. **Privacy-preserving geofencing** using Zero-Knowledge Proofs ensures location compliance without exposing raw GPS data or infrastructure topology—delivering mathematical certainty to regulators while preserving user and enterprise privacy.

![The Solution: A Zero-Trust, HW-Rooted, Unified, Extensible & Verifiable Identity](images/Slide7.PNG)

A "Sovereign" system that only secures the input or output is a broken chain. For Tier-1 financial institutions, trust must be established at the source, maintained in the cloud, and verified at the edge.

1.  **Verified Ingress**: Hardware-rooted attestation of the originating client device ensuring data provenance and **Regulation K (Reg-K)** geographic compliance via **privacy-preserving techniques** (e.g., Zero-Knowledge Proofs / ZKPs).
    *   *Customer Value:* **Radical Privacy**—verify compliance without tracking movement history.
2.  **Trusted Processing**: Confidential Computing (TEEs) and Platform Integrity (Keylime) ensuring the AI workload is isolated from the cloud infrastructure.
    *   *Customer Value:* **Absolute Data Sovereignty**—ensuring personal financial data is never exposed to third-party infrastructure.
3.  **Verifiable Egress**: Hardware-rooted verification ensuring insights are released only to identity-verified and geofenced endpoints.
    *   *Customer Value:* **Security of Outcome**—guaranteeing that sensitive financial insights are delivered only to the authorized user's verified device.

### The Privacy-Preserving Story: Compliance without Tracking

A core pillar of AegisSovereignAI is **Privacy-Preserving Geofencing**. Traditional geofencing relies on capturing and storing raw GPS coordinates, which creates a significant privacy risk and tracking liability.

AegisSovereignAI solves this by implementing **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Geofencing** for both ingress and egress:

#### Ingress (User Device → Sovereign Cloud)
- **Prover-Side (User Device)**: The mobile sensor sidecar generates a Zero-Knowledge Proof that the device is within an authorized zone.
- **Verifier-Side (Sovereign Cloud)**: The verifier validates the proof's mathematical correctness without ever seeing, storing, or processing the raw latitude and longitude.
- **Customer Value**: Users can prove they are in a compliant region (e.g., EU/EEA for Reg-K) without exposing their precise location.

#### Egress (Data Center → User/External System)
- **Prover-Side (Data Center Workload)**: The AI workload or server proves it is operating within an authorized data sovereignty zone (e.g., "on-prem in NYC" or "Equinix Madrid").
- **Verifier-Side (Policy Engine/Gateway)**: The Envoy gateway or policy engine validates the ZKP before releasing sensitive data or PII.
- **Customer Value**: Enterprises can cryptographically prove data residency compliance to regulators without exposing infrastructure topology.

**The Result**: Total privacy for users and enterprises, with mathematical certainty for regulators. Location is verified at both ingress and egress, but raw movement history or infrastructure details are never created.

## PoC Implementation Coverage of Enterprise Use Cases

This PoC provides end-to-end implementation for **Stage 2 (Trusted Processing) and Stage 3 (Verifiable Egress)** of the Sovereign Trust Loop. Stage 1 (Verified Ingress) is defined architecturally (see Architecture Documentation section below).

| Use Case | Stage 1: Verified Ingress | Stage 2: Trusted Processing | Stage 3: Verifiable Egress | PoC Status |
|----------|---------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|------------|
| **Enterprise Customer** | 🔲 Roadmap (ZKP Pilot) | ✅ Implemented | ✅ Implemented | Full (Processing + Egress) |
| **Enterprise Employee** | 🔲 Roadmap (ZKP Pilot) | ✅ Implemented | ✅ Implemented | Full (Processing + Egress) |
| **Enterprise Tenant** | N/A (Internal isolation) | ✅ Implemented | ✅ Implemented | Full |
| **Regulator** | 🔲 Roadmap (ZKP Pilot) | ✅ Implemented | ✅ Implemented | Full (Processing + Egress) |

**What This PoC Currently Demonstrates:**
- ✅ Hardware-rooted identity (TPM attestation via Keylime)
- ✅ Hardware-Rooted Geofencing (Egress): Unified SPIFFE/SPIRE identity with geolocation claims (sensor metadata in SVID)
- ✅ **Privacy-preserving Geofencing (ZKP):** Zero-Knowledge geofence proofs (Rust sidecar) integrated into SVIDs.
- ✅ **Stateless Verification:** Verification of ZKPs without trusted setup or shared secrets (transparent proofs).
- ✅ Envoy-based policy enforcement (fail-closed WASM filtering with real-time ZKP verification)
- ✅ Degraded SVID detection (insider threat protection)
- ✅ mTLS with hardware-bound certificates (workload attestation)

This includes the hardware-rooted identity bridge between Sovereign and Private clouds. **Stage 1 (Verified Ingress)** is currently defined as an architectural roadmap.

## SPIRE Overlay Architecture

This project uses a **SPIRE overlay system** to maintain custom modifications without forking the entire SPIRE codebase (99.7% reduction: 50 patch files instead of 17,315 fork files).

### Quick Overview

**Production Build:**
```bash
./scripts/spire-build.sh          # Builds SPIRE v1.14.1 with Aegis patches
ls build/spire-binaries/          # Output: spire-server, spire-agent
```

**What's Modified:**
- **Proto API extensions**: Hardware attestation types, sovereign attestation parameters
- **Core patches**: Attestation endpoints, credential composition, feature flags
- **Aegis plugins**: Keylime integration, policy engine, unified identity

**Development Workflow** (modifying SPIRE code):
```bash
./scripts/spire-dev-setup.sh      # 1. Setup dev environment
cd build/spire-dev/spire && vim pkg/server/api/agent/v1/service.go  # 2. Make changes
cd ../../.. && ./scripts/spire-dev-extract.sh   # 3. Extract to patches

## Quick Start Guide

This section provides a step-by-step guide to set up and run the complete hybrid cloud unified identity demonstration.

### Prerequisites

For a smooth installation, your system should meet the core requirements:
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (recommended)
- **Hardware**: Two machines with static IPs (e.g., 10.1.0.11), TPM 2.0 (hardware or software)
- **Toolchains**: Python 3.10+, Go 1.22+, Rust 1.92+

#### Installation Scripts

Two helper scripts are provided to simplify setup:

1. **`check_packages.sh`** - Check installed packages and versions:
   ```bash
   ./check_packages.sh              # Check local system
   ./check_packages.sh 10.1.0.10    # Check remote system via SSH
   ```

2. **`install_prerequisites.sh`** - Install all required packages:
   ```bash
   ./install_prerequisites.sh              # Install on local system
   ./install_prerequisites.sh 10.1.0.10     # Install on remote system via SSH
   ```

**Note:** The installation script will:
- Update package lists
- Install all required Linux packages
- Install/update Rust toolchain (if not present)
- Install/update Go toolchain (if not present or version < 1.20)
- Install required Python packages
- Set up TSS group and add user to it

#### Post-Installation Configuration

After running the installation script:

1. **For Rust:** Run `source $HOME/.cargo/env` or add to `~/.bashrc`:
   ```bash
   echo 'source $HOME/.cargo/env' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. **For Go:** Ensure `/usr/local/go/bin` is in your PATH. Add to `~/.bashrc`:
   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

3. **For TSS group:** Log out and back in if you were added to the `tss` group (required for TPM access)

4. **Reload shell configuration:**
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

#### Build SPIRE and Keylime Components

After prerequisites are installed, build the required components:

```bash
# Build SPIRE server and agent
cd spire
make bin/spire-server bin/spire-agent
cd ..

# Build rust-keylime agent
cd rust-keylime
cargo build --release
cd ..

# Build ZKP prover
cd mobile-sensor-microservice/zkp-prover-plonky2
cargo build --release
cd ../..
```

**Note:** The test scripts (`test_agents.sh`, `test_onprem.sh`) provide automated build-if-needed logic, detecting source changes to ensure the latest code is always deployed. Building may take several minutes the first time; subsequent builds will be faster due to caching.

#### Troubleshooting Installation

**Rust not found after installation:**
```bash
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

**Go not found after installation:**
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

**TPM access denied:**
1. Verify user is in `tss` group: `groups | grep tss`
2. If not, add user: `sudo usermod -a -G tss $USER`
3. **Log out and back in** (required)
4. Verify TPM device: `ls -l /dev/tpm*`

**Python packages not found:**
```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install spiffe cryptography grpcio protobuf requests
```

### Port Configuration

This section documents all port numbers used by the test scripts. All ports are unique with no conflicts between hosts.

#### On 10.1.0.11 (Sovereign Cloud/Edge Cloud)

**Started by `test_control_plane.sh`:**
- **8881** - Keylime Verifier (HTTPS)
- **8890** - Keylime Registrar (HTTP)
- **8891** - Keylime Registrar (HTTPS/TLS)

| 9443 | mTLS Server | 10.1.0.10 | test_onprem.sh | HTTPS |

**Port Conflict Analysis:** ✅ No conflicts detected. All ports are unique and assigned to different services on different hosts.

### Demo Act 1: Trusted Infrastructure Setup

*See Slide 19 for the architecture diagram*

**SOVEREIGN PUBLIC/EDGE CLOUD CONTROL PLANE WINDOW:** (e.g., 10.1.0.11)
```bash
cd ~/AegisSovereignAI/hybrid-cloud-poc
./test_control_plane.sh --no-pause

# Verify processes are running
ps -aux | grep spire-server
ps -aux | grep keylime.cmd.verifier
ps -aux | grep keylime.cmd.registrar

# Health checks (optional but recommended)
# Check SPIRE Server health
./spire/bin/spire-server healthcheck -socketPath /tmp/spire-server/private/api.sock

# Check Keylime Verifier endpoint
curl -k https://localhost:8881/version || curl http://localhost:8881/version

# Check Keylime Registrar endpoint
curl http://localhost:8890/version

# Check service logs for errors
tail -20 /tmp/spire-server.log
tail -20 /tmp/keylime-verifier.log
tail -20 /tmp/keylime-registrar.log
```

**ON PREM API GATEWAY WINDOW:** (e.g., 10.1.0.10)
```bash
cd ~/AegisSovereignAI/hybrid-cloud-poc/enterprise-private-cloud
./test_onprem.sh --no-pause

# Verify processes are running
ps -aux | grep envoy
ps -aux | grep mobile-sensor-microservice
ps -aux | grep mtls-server

# Health checks (optional but recommended)
# Check Envoy is listening on port 8080
sudo ss -tlnp | grep :8080 || sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :8080

# Check Mobile Location Service endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/verify -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'

# Check mTLS Server is listening on port 9443
sudo ss -tlnp | grep :9443 || sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :9443

# Check service logs for errors
tail -20 /opt/envoy/logs/envoy.log
tail -20 /tmp/mobile-sensor.log
tail -20 /tmp/mtls-server.log
```

**Quick Verification Summary:**

After running both setup scripts, verify all services are healthy:

**On Control Plane (10.1.0.11):**
```bash
# All services should show running processes
ps aux | grep -E "spire-server|keylime.cmd.verifier|keylime.cmd.registrar" | grep -v grep

# Quick health check one-liner
echo "SPIRE Server: $(./spire/bin/spire-server healthcheck -socketPath /tmp/spire-server/private/api.sock 2>&1 | head -1)"
echo "Keylime Verifier: $(curl -s -k https://localhost:8881/version 2>&1 | head -1 || echo 'not responding')"
echo "Keylime Registrar: $(curl -s http://localhost:8890/version 2>&1 | head -1 || echo 'not responding')"
```

**On On-Prem Gateway (10.1.0.10):**
```bash
# All services should show running processes
ps aux | grep -E "envoy|mobile-sensor|mtls-server" | grep -v grep

# Quick health check one-liner
echo "Envoy (port 8080): $(sudo ss -tlnp 2>/dev/null | grep :8080 >/dev/null && echo 'listening' || echo 'not listening')"
echo "Mobile Service (port 5000): $(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/verify -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}' 2>&1 | head -1 || echo 'not responding')"
echo "mTLS Server (port 9443): $(sudo ss -tlnp 2>/dev/null | grep :9443 >/dev/null && echo 'listening' || echo 'not listening')"
```

**Common Issues:**
- If services don't start: Check logs in `/tmp/` (control plane) or `/opt/envoy/logs/` and `/tmp/` (on-prem)
- If ports are in use: Run cleanup scripts or manually stop conflicting services
- If health checks fail: Wait a few seconds for services to fully initialize, then retry

### Demo Act 2: The Happy Path (Proof of Geofencing)

*See Slides 7 and 19 for solution architecture and implementation details*

This act demonstrates the complete flow from workload attestation through successful geolocation verification.

#### Step 1: Start SPIRE Agent and Workload Services (e.g., 10.1.0.11)

**SOVEREIGN PUBLIC/EDGE CLOUD AGENT WINDOW:** (e.g., 10.1.0.11)
```bash
cd ~/AegisSovereignAI/hybrid-cloud-poc
./test_agents.sh --no-pause
```

**What this script does:**
- Configures SPIRE Agent with TPM support
- Configures rust-keylime Agent with TPM support
- Creates SPIRE TPM Plugin server (sidecar)
- Registers agents with Keylime Registrar
- Creates SPIRE registration entries for workloads
- Tests the complete attestation flow
- Verifies workload SVID issuance with unified identity

**Expected output:**
- SPIRE Agent running with Workload API on Unix socket
- rust-keylime Agent running on port 9002
- TPM Plugin Server running and ready for certification requests

**Monitor logs (optional):**
```bash
# In separate terminals, watch logs:
tail -f /tmp/spire-agent.log            # SPIRE Agent
tail -f /tmp/rust-keylime-agent.log     # rust-keylime Agent
tail -f /tmp/tpm-plugin-server.log      # SPIRE TPM Plugin

# Or use the attestation watch script (filters for attestation events):
./watch-spire-agent-attestations.sh    # SPIRE Agent attestations only
```

**Verify setup:**
```bash
# Check SPIRE Agent health
spire-agent healthcheck

# Check SPIRE Server status
spire-server bundle show
```

#### Step 2: Start mTLS Client and Verify End-to-End Flow (e.g., 10.1.0.11)

**SOVEREIGN PUBLIC/EDGE CLOUD CLIENT APP WINDOW:** (e.g., 10.1.0.11)
```bash
cd ~/AegisSovereignAI/hybrid-cloud-poc
./test_mtls_client.sh
```

**Note:** The client automatically saves the workload SVID certificate chain to `/tmp/svid-dump/svid.pem` for inspection.

**What happens:**

1. Client connects to SPIRE Agent Workload API
2. SPIRE Agent attests the client process and matches to registration entry
3. SPIRE Agent requests workload SVID from SPIRE Server
4. Workload SVID inherits unified identity claims from agent SVID (geolocation, TPM attestation)
5. Client uses workload SVID for mTLS connection to Envoy
6. Envoy verifies SPIRE certificate signature using SPIRE CA bundle
7. Envoy WASM filter extracts sensor ID and type from certificate chain
8. Envoy WASM filter behavior:
    - GPS/GNSS sensors: Trusted hardware, bypass mobile location service (allow directly)
    - Mobile sensors: Calls Mobile Location Service to verify geolocation
      - Prioritizes **DB-less flow** using coordinates/MSISDN extracted from SVID claims
      - Falls back to DB-BASED lookup if SVID data is incomplete
      - Mobile Location Service handles CAMARA API caching (15-min TTL, configurable)
10. Backend server logs the sensor ID for audit trail

**Expected output:**
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  mTLS Client Starting with SPIRE SVID (Automatic Renewal)      ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
SPIRE Agent socket: /tmp/spire-agent/public/api.sock
Server: e.g., 10.1.0.10:8080

  Mode: SPIRE (automatic SVID renewal enabled)
  ✓ Got initial SVID: spiffe://example.org/mtls-client
  ✓ Connected to server
  📤 Sending: HELLO #1
  📥 Received: SERVER ACK: HELLO #1
```

**Monitor client logs (optional):**
```bash
# Watch client output in the same terminal, or in a separate terminal:
tail -f /tmp/mtls-client-app.log
```

#### Step 3: Verify End-to-End Flow and Inspect Unified Identity Claims

**ON PREM API GATEWAY WINDOW:** (e.g., 10.1.0.10)
```bash
cd ~/AegisSovereignAI/hybrid-cloud-poc/enterprise-private-cloud
./watch-envoy-logs.sh
```

**Check Envoy logs for sensor verification:**
```bash
# On e.g., 10.1.0.10
sudo tail -f /opt/envoy/logs/envoy.log | grep -E '(sensor|verification|cache|TTL)'
```

**Expected log entries:**
- For mobile sensors:
  - `[LOCATION VERIFY] Initiating location verification...`
  - `[CACHE MISS]` or `[API CALL]` (first call)
  - `[CACHE HIT]` (subsequent calls within cache TTL)
  - `[LOCATION VERIFY] Location verification completed: result=true`
- For GPS/GNSS sensors:
  - `GPS/GNSS sensor: Trusted hardware, no mobile location service call needed - allowing request`
- `Sensor verification successful`

**ON PREM MOBILE LOCATION SERVICE WINDOW:** (e.g., 10.1.0.10)
```bash
cd ~/AegisSovereignAI/hybrid-cloud-poc/enterprise-private-cloud
./watch-mobile-sensor-logs.sh
```

**Check Mobile Location Service logs:**
```bash
# On e.g., 10.1.0.10
tail -f /tmp/mobile-sensor.log | grep -E '(CAMARA|authorize|token|verify_location|\[CACHE|\[LOCATION VERIFY|\[API)'
```

**Expected log entries:**
- `CAMARA verify_location caching: ENABLED (TTL: 900 seconds = 15.0 minutes)`
- `[LOCATION VERIFY] Initiating location verification...`
- `[CACHE MISS]` or `[API CALL]` (first call)
- `[CACHE HIT]` (subsequent calls within cache TTL)
- `[API RESPONSE] CAMARA verify_location API response... [CACHED for 900 seconds]`

**ON PREM SERVER APP WINDOW:** (e.g., 10.1.0.10)
```bash
cd ~/AegisSovereignAI/hybrid-cloud-poc/enterprise-private-cloud
./watch-mtls-server-logs.sh
```

**Check mTLS Server logs:**
```bash
# On e.g., 10.1.0.10
tail -f /tmp/mtls-server.log | grep -E '(Sensor ID|X-Sensor-ID)'
```

**Expected log entries:**
- `Client X HTTP GET /hello: HELLO #N [Sensor ID: 12d1:1433]`

**Check SPIRE Agent attestation:**
```bash
# On e.g., 10.1.0.11
./watch-spire-agent-attestations.sh
```

**Expected log entries showing:**
- Agent attestation with TPM App Key certification
- Unified identity SVID issuance with geolocation claims
- Workload SVID inheritance from agent SVID

**Inspect Unified Identity Claims:**
```bash
# On e.g., 10.1.0.11
# The SVID is automatically saved by test_mtls_client.sh to /tmp/svid-dump/svid.pem
# Inspect the SVID and claims
./scripts/dump-svid-attested-claims.sh /tmp/svid-dump/svid.pem
```

**Expected output shows:**
- Workload SPIFFE ID
- Agent SVID in certificate chain
- **AttestedClaims** including:
  - `grc.geolocation.*` (sensor_id, type, latitude, longitude)
  - `grc.tpm-attestation.*` (App Key cert, TPM quote data)
  - `grc.workload.*` (workload ID, key source)

### Demo Act 3: The Defense (The Rogue Admin)

*This demonstrates protection against insider threats as described in Slide 6*

This act demonstrates how the system detects and blocks insider threats when hardware integrity is compromised.

**SOVEREIGN PUBLIC/EDGE CLOUD AGENT WINDOW:** (e.g., 10.1.0.11)
```bash
cd ~/AegisSovereignAI/hybrid-cloud-poc
./watch-spire-agent-attestations.sh
```
**SOVEREIGN PUBLIC/EDGE CLOUD CLIENT APP WINDOW:** (e.g., 10.1.0.11)
```bash
cd ~/AegisSovereignAI/hybrid-cloud-poc
./test_mtls_client.sh
```
**SOVEREIGN PUBLIC/EDGE CLOUD ROGUE ADMIN WINDOW:** (e.g., 10.1.0.11)
```bash
cd ~/AegisSovereignAI/hybrid-cloud-poc
./test_rogue_admin.sh

# Simulate rogue admin disconnecting the USB Mobile Sensor
sudo ./test_toggle_huawei_mobile_sensor.sh off

# Wait for system to detect the change and issue degraded SVID
# Then reconnect sensor to restore normal operation
sudo ./test_toggle_huawei_mobile_sensor.sh on
```

**What happens:**
1. Rogue admin disconnects USB Mobile Sensor (simulating physical tampering)
2. Keylime Agent detects the USB disconnect event via Dynamic Hardware Integrity monitoring
3. Hardware integrity score drops, triggering degraded attestation
4. SPIRE Agent attempts to refresh SVID but receives Degraded SVID (valid for network, missing Proof of Residency)
5. Client retries connection with degraded SVID
6. Envoy WASM Plugin verifies certificate and detects missing geolocation claim
8. System successfully blocks the request, proving protection against insider threats.

> **Degraded SVID Policy**: In a regulated enterprise, "Degraded SVIDs" are strictly policy-enforced. The Envoy API Gateway is configured to return a **403 Forbidden** for all PII-touching or sensitive "Green Zone" endpoints when a degraded SVID is presented, potentially triggering an immediate SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) alert.

**ON PREM API GATEWAY WINDOW:** (e.g., 10.1.0.10)
```bash
cd ~/AegisSovereignAI/hybrid-cloud-poc/enterprise-private-cloud
./watch-envoy-logs.sh
```
**ON PREM MOBILE LOCATION SERVICE WINDOW:** (e.g., 10.1.0.10)
```bash
cd ~/AegisSovereignAI/hybrid-cloud-poc/enterprise-private-cloud
./watch-mobile-sensor-logs.sh
```
**ON PREM SERVER APP WINDOW:** (e.g., 10.1.0.10)
```bash
cd ~/AegisSovereignAI/hybrid-cloud-poc/enterprise-private-cloud
./watch-mtls-server-logs.sh
```

**Expected log entries:**
- Envoy logs show: `403 Forbidden` with `Geo Claim Missing` error
- SPIRE Agent logs show: Degraded SVID issuance (missing geolocation claims)
- Keylime Agent logs show: USB sensor disconnect detection

### Troubleshooting

**Unified Identity - SVID missing geolocation claims:**
- Verify Keylime Verifier has verified the agent: `curl -k https://localhost:8881/v2.1/agents/`
- Check `unified_identity_enabled: true` is set in both `spire-server.conf` and `spire-agent.conf`.
- Ensure the Mobile Sensor Sidecar is reachable from the Keylime Verifier.

**Delegated Certification failing (Task 14b):**
- Verify the TPM Plugin Server is using HTTPS (mTLS) to talk to the rust-keylime agent.
- Check for "JSON format mismatch" in `/tmp/tpm-plugin-server.log`.
- Ensure `agent_uuid` in the attestation request matches the one registered in Keylime.

**mTLS Handshake Errors (Envoy/Client):**
- **Clock Drift**: Ensure all machines have synchronized time: `sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org`.
- **Bundle Mismatch**: Verify Envoy has the latest SPIRE bundle: `openssl x509 -in /opt/envoy/certs/spire-bundle.pem -text -noout`.
- **WASM Fail-Closed**: If the WASM filter cannot reach the Mobile Sidecar, it will block connections with a 403. Check `/opt/envoy/logs/envoy.log` for upstream connection errors.

**SPIRE Agent not attesting:**
- Check TPM is accessible: `ls -la /dev/tpm*`
- Verify TPM Plugin Server is running: `ps aux | grep tpm-plugin`
- Check SPIRE Agent logs: `tail -f /tmp/spire-agent.log`

**Envoy not verifying certificates:**
- Verify SPIRE bundle exists: `ls -la /opt/envoy/certs/spire-bundle.pem`
- Check Envoy config: `sudo envoy --config-path /opt/envoy/envoy.yaml --mode validate`

**Mobile Location Service failing:**
- Check CAMARA core credentials in the mapping database (not environment variables in production).
- Verify sensor ID in database: `sqlite3 mobile-sensor-microservice/sensor_mapping.db "SELECT * FROM sensor_map;"`

**Client connection fails:**
- Verify Envoy certificate is copied: `ls -la ~/.mtls-demo/envoy-cert.pem`
- Check firewall rules: `sudo iptables -L -n | grep 8080`
- Verify SPIRE Agent socket: `ls -la /tmp/spire-agent/public/api.sock`

## Logs

### Log File Locations

**On 10.1.0.11 (Sovereign Cloud):**
- SPIRE Server: `/tmp/spire-server.log`
- SPIRE Agent: `/tmp/spire-agent.log`
- Keylime Verifier: `/tmp/keylime-verifier.log`
- rust-keylime Agent: `/tmp/rust-keylime-agent.log`
- TPM Plugin Server: `/tmp/tpm-plugin-server.log`

**On e.g., 10.1.0.10 (On-Prem):**
- Envoy: `/opt/envoy/logs/envoy.log` (requires sudo)
- mTLS Server: `/tmp/mtls-server.log`
- Mobile Location Service: `/tmp/mobile-sensor.log`

### Watch Logs During Demo

For monitoring logs during a demo, use the watch scripts:

**Option 1: Individual terminal windows**
```bash
cd enterprise-private-cloud

# Terminal 1 - Envoy logs
./watch-envoy-logs.sh

# Terminal 2 - mTLS server logs
./watch-mtls-server-logs.sh

# Terminal 3 - Mobile sensor service logs
./watch-mobile-sensor-logs.sh
```

**Option 2: Single tmux session (all logs in one window)**
```bash
cd enterprise-private-cloud
./watch-all-logs.sh
```

This creates a tmux session with 3 panes showing all logs simultaneously.

## Demo Script: 3-Act Presentation

For a guided demonstration following the slide deck structure:

```bash
./demo-3-act-presentation.sh
```

This script automates the 3-Act demonstration flow (Setup → Happy Path → Defense) described in the Demo Act sections above, with automatic pauses and slide references for presentations.

**Prerequisites:** All services running on both machines (see Demo Act 1-3 above for details).
